# Devops- An agile method
Devops can be said to be the latest development method; way to organize system development projects, that has become popular within the IT industry.
Whether it is really to be seen as an actual agile method or something else, like a description of a job position seems to be under debate though. 
(J., Roche. http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?ref=rss&id=2540984 ,2013). From the perspective of an agile method Devops can shortly be described as follows: 
within Devops the aim is to make people within system development, system maintance and quality assurance work closer together. That is in contrast to how 
one used to separate the development, deployment and maintance of IT-systems within previous methods like the waterfall method. Development and deployment
/maintenance/support are no longer to be seen as separated entities that is dealt with in sequence after one another. As described in an article by John Roche: 
"The waterfall is now a river; development and operations flow together. When a product launches, there are seldom plans to upgrade or deprecate functionality, 
and support is ongoing."(J., Roche. http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?ref=rss&id=2540984, 2013). What this means is that instead of writing a complete requirement 
specification before starting the actual software development; programming, one works in cycles of development with continues loop backs to the requirement 
specification to see if any requirement needs to change. 

In this cycle methodology, support, maintenance and quality assurance are all important components. According to the above referenced article this also means 
that the responsibility for the risk definition, maintainability, quality and actual deployment of the software application in Devops becomes more of a shared 
responsibility for developers as well as operations (maintenance/support) and quality assurance. This stands in contrast to how it has generally been done within 
for example the waterfall model in which this responsibility as well as other specific aspects of the system development process has been more closely tied to 
individual professional groups. One way that this effects the job for developers is that one works with continuous deployment, evaluation, etc. One of the results 
of successfully working according to Devops is that one has more of a long-term perspective on the life of the IT-system, which hopefully means that one can save 
both money and time and make the customer more satisfied over time. 

The reason Devops was 'invented' and has become so popular was because of a need within the software development industry to better measure and detect problems 
in networked systems. J.Roche (see link to article above) describes that one thing that made the move towards Devops possible was the invention of technical tools 
for problem diagnosis, deployment management, task automatation and process standardization. One important part of working according to Devops is bug priority and 
the use of test goals as a way of assesing whether a system version should be released or not. In the end one can make more informed decisions about this based on 
metrics and data that one collects throught the above described tools and by using more automated processes when testing and deploying. As described by Mandi Walls 
(M.,Walls, Building a Devops culture, 2013) for Devops to work it isn't enough with new tools (as the ones described above), one also has to change the organizational 
culture to be able to successfully adapt to Devops as a software development process. To make the needed cultural change Walls suggest that there needs to be more 
open communication between different teams (developers, operations, etc.) about requirements, schedules, resources, etc. This stands in contrast to previous working 
culture in which one preferably used ticketing systems to communicate about these things. Walls also describes that this moves the focus of everyones work to the product, 
away from focus on just a part of the product and ones own team sphere. This means that everyone across professional roles has access to production and build metrics and 
through this they are all part of the bigger process (M., Walls, Building a Devops culture, 2013, s.1-3).

Similarly in another article the description of what is needed for Devops are defined as four specific dimensions: collaboration, automation, measurement and monitoring 
(L.E,Lwakatare1, P.,Kuvaja1, M.,Oivo1, Dimensions of Devops, 2015). In this same article it is described how in one way Devops can be seen as a way of taking the previously 
popularized agile methods one step further. By this one means that even when talking about agile methods in general, important aspects are cross-functional teams and closer 
collaboration with customer. The 'new' thing within Devops is the focus on extending this communication and collaboration so that it involves both development and operations, 
it is described that: "The continuous deployment paradigm requires software companies to increase communication amongst stakeholders, implement automation and improve agility 
in designing, delivering and operating software products and services" (L.E,Lwakatare1, P.,Kuvaja1, M.,Oivo1, Dimensions of Devops, 2015, s.1). As some of the articles touch 
on in their descriptions of Devops it is a quite new method which means that it still needs to be evaluated before one can say something about how it stands in comparison to 
other agile methods, not least the discussion about how to exactly define what Devops is will probobly go on for at least a while since there seems to be some debate and 
what I would call a bit of confusion on the subject.
